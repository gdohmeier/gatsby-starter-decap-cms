## tic-tac-toe

I implemented a simple tic-tac-toe game with javascript that can be played within a web page. On 8/11/23 I updated the code with some simple ai to pick best move to make the game more difficult to win.

## Click [TIC-TACK-TOE](/contact/tic-tac-toe) for the game.

I reposted the game to this new site. Here is a link to the game on the old site: <https://garydohmeier.com/a-game-test/>
