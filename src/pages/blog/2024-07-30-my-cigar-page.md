I have taken up the hobby of enjoying cigars, with or without a good whiskey.  Cigars and other tobacco products are (of course) for adult consumption only and should not be used by minors. Disclaimer, they are likely not great for your health, but can be very enjoyable if used responsibly.

I have created this page to list and keep track of the cigars I have tried and do like.  I will update this list as I try more and will add some ranking and reviews as I gain experience.  As we build our homestead over the next couple years, I intend to build a cigar & whisky bar, with AC since we are in Florida - I will add a new blog post about that as I bring it from fantasy to reality.

### Here is a list of cigars I have tried and that I like

1. G2 habano pirate  (my current favorite)
2. Oliva G, O, V
3. Olivia Cain F
4. Florida Man
5. Olivia Master Blends 3, 2006
6. Hoyo De Monterrey, Excalibur
7. Mayflower dusk
8. Diesel
9. Cigarillos:\
   Macanudo Ascots\
   Romeo Y Juliette\
   Cohiba (blue)\
10. Rocky Patel, Barrel Aged
