As the date for my retirement approached, I thought it would be fun to create a count down timer to the last day.  I have made a few iterations to it over the last couple of days.  



The code for the countdown clock is in gitlab [here.](https://gitlab.com/gdohmeier/countdown?ref=dohmeier.dyndns.info)
