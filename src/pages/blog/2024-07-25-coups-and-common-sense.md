An [article](https://amgreatness.com/2023/01/05/the-coup-we-never-knew/) by Victor Davis Hanson "The Coup We Never Knew" on the American Greatness website asks many questions that seem to be about common sense.  



Seems to me that many people today have lost their common sense.  They have bought into a crazy idealogy that teaches the opposite of what is true is the truth.  This "woke" cult changes and twists accepted language, pits people against each other and 'cancels' anyone who does not accept its lunacy. If I disagree with wokeness, it does not mean I hate or am phobic, it just means I disagree. The freedom to disagree peacfully is the american way and is common sense. Trying to redefine common sense is nonsence.



Whether you are liberal or conservative, the article by Victor is worth a read and some reflection.
