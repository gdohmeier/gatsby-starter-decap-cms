    An independent publication launched in May 2023. 
description: This site is a Jamstack site using git to store and serve content,
  netlify for hosting, and Gatsby for the dynamic build and Decap CMS for easy
  updates. Other than the time to update the code and migrate my site from my
  local server it cost nothing to build. If you like it, please read on. If you
  don't (and I'm sorry thats the case) there are other sites on the interwebs to
  try.

  heading: My old site is being migrated hereâ€¦
  description: >
    My old site garydohmeier.com is a from a jamstack ghost and gatsby
    starter.  I am migrating it too this site which is jamstack gatsby and
    decapcms.  The old site required that I run and serve pages from my local
    server (which was a pain); with this site every part is cloud based.  Also,
    running this site is (currently) totally free!
